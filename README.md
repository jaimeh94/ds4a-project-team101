## Introduction
Data Science for All (DS4A) Colombia, is an intensive training program oriented to providing skills in data science and related subjects.

This program is sponsored by MinTiC (Ministry of Information Technology of Colombia) and developed by Correlation One. The authors of the present document were enrolled in cohort #6 of this program, held between March and July of 2022.

Besides attending classes and presenting the regular assignments, the students enrolled in this program must complete a Capstone Project, which is a team initiative to solve one real-world business problem or opportunity, applying the tools and methods learned during the DS4A program.
